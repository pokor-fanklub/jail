## Assumptions
In order for programs to be checked in a uniform, deterministic and fair manner, a few requirements should be outlined.
* No access to the current time
* No random values in memory
* Pragmas as banned
* Caching to absolute minimum
* Time measured by instruction count
* Only one thread
* Multiple runnings to take the average (?)
